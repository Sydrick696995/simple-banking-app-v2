   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up MySQL database on PythonAnywhere:
   - Go to the Databases tab in your PythonAnywhere dashboard
   - Create a new MySQL database
   - Note the database name, username, and password
   - Update your .env file with these credentials

5. Initialize your database on PythonAnywhere:
   ```
   python init_db.py
   ```

6. Configure a new web app via the PythonAnywhere dashboard:
   - Select "Manual configuration"
   - Choose Python 3.8
   - Set source code directory to `/home/yourusername/simple-banking-app-v2`
   - Set working directory to `/home/yourusername/simple-banking-app-v2`
   - Set WSGI configuration file to point to your Flask app

7. Add environment variables in the PythonAnywhere dashboard for security

- Toggle admin status for users
- View all user transactions
- Monitor and audit admin activities

## User Roles

The system supports three types of user roles:

1. **Regular Users** - Can manage their own account, make transfers, and view their transaction history.

2. **Admin Users** - Have all regular user privileges plus:
   - Approve/reject new user registrations
   - Activate/deactivate user accounts
   - Create new user accounts
   - Make deposits to user accounts
   - Edit user information

3. **Manager Users** - Have all admin privileges plus:
   - Create and manage admin accounts
   - View admin transaction logs
   - Monitor all system transfers
   - System-wide oversight capabilities

## Address Management with PSGC API

The application integrates with the Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) API to provide standardized address selection for user profiles. The address system follows the Philippine geographical hierarchy:

- Region
- Province
- City/Municipality
- Barangay

This integration ensures addresses are standardized and validates location data according to the Philippine geographical structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: MySQL (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, Werkzeug, Flask-Bcrypt
- **Forms**: Flask-WTF, WTForms
- **Security**: Flask-Limiter for API rate limiting, CSRF protection
- **External API**: PSGC API for Philippine geographic data

## Rate Limiting

The application uses Flask-Limiter to implement API rate limiting, which protects against potential DoS attacks and abusive bot activity. The rate limits are configured as follows:

- **Login**: 10 attempts per minute
- **Registration**: 5 attempts per minute
- **Password Reset**: 5 attempts per hour
- **Money Transfer**: 20 attempts per hour
- **API Endpoints**: 30 requests per minute
- **Admin Dashboard**: 60 requests per hour
- **Admin Account Creation**: 20 accounts per hour
- **Admin Deposits**: 30 deposits per hour
- **Manager Dashboard**: 60 requests per hour
- **Admin Creation**: 10 admin accounts per hour

By default, the rate limiting data is stored in memory. For production use, it's recommended to use Redis as a storage backend for persistence across application restarts. To enable Redis storage:

1. Install Redis server on your system
2. Update the `.env` file with your Redis URL:
   ```
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
   ```

If Redis is not available, the application will automatically fall back to in-memory storage.

### üîê IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY SYDRICK B. PARRA


### üìã Overview

As part of our security enhancement and audit tracking initiative, we implemented a robust **Admin Action Logging System** designed to record all critical actions performed by privileged users (i.e., admins and managers). This feature complements the existing `Transaction` model by focusing on **who did what**, not just money movement.

All additions are marked in the source code with:

```python
# (SYD) ADDED ADMIN LOG
```

---

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Why This Was Added

Modern web applications ‚Äî especially those handling sensitive financial data ‚Äî face several critical security risks:

* **Privilege Abuse**: Admin users may accidentally or intentionally make unauthorized changes without oversight.
* **Lack of Traceability**: Without proper logging, it is difficult to trace who made what change and when.
* **Insecure Audit Practices**: Applications often focus on transaction records but overlook administrative actions, which can have equal or greater impact.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we implemented a secure, centralized audit system:

* Ensures **transparency** for all administrative operations.
* Supports **accountability** through a non-repudiable log.
* Aligns with **OWASP best practices**, including "Logging & Monitoring" and "Security Misconfiguration" prevention.

By monitoring all privileged user activity, this system dramatically reduces the risk of silent privilege misuse and ensures that all critical changes are recorded.

---

### üß± New Components Introduced

#### ‚úÖ `AdminActionLog` Model

A new SQLAlchemy model added to `models.py`:

```python
class AdminActionLog(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    admin_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    action = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=False)
    details = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

Purpose:

* Tracks all privileged administrative actions (not only financial).
* Maintains accountability and supports audit/compliance requirements.
* Used only by admins and managers, not exposed to regular users.

---

#### ‚úÖ `log_admin_action()` Utility Function

Added to `routes.py`:

```python
def log_admin_action(admin_id, action, details):
    print(f"[DEBUG] Logging admin action: {action}")  # (SYD) ADDED ADMIN LOG
    log = AdminActionLog(
        admin_id=admin_id,
        action=action,
        details=details,
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
    )
    db.session.add(log)
    db.session.commit()
```

This function is reusable across routes for all administrative events.

---

### üîß Routes Enhanced with Admin Logging

We added logging to the following administrative routes:

| Route                         | Action Logged                    | Example Entry                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `/admin/deposit`              | Admin deposits to a user         | "Deposited ‚Ç±500 to user: johndoe"                  |
| `/execute_transfer`           | Transfers performed by admins    | "Transferred ‚Ç±500 to janedoe"                      |
| `/admin/activate_user/<id>`   | User account activation          | "Activated user: johndoe"                          |
| `/admin/deactivate_user/<id>` | User account deactivation        | "Deactivated user: janedoe"                        |
| `/admin/edit_user/<id>`       | User information updated         | "Edited user: johndoe. Changes made: email, phone" |
| `/admin/create_account`       | Admin creates a regular user     | "Created new user account: johndoe"                |
| `/manager/create_admin`       | Manager creates an admin account | "Created new admin account: admin1"                |
| `/manager/toggle_admin/<id>`  | Promote/demote admin role        | "Promoted user: staff1" / "Demoted user: admin1"   |
| `/login` and `/logout`        | Admin or manager login/logout    | "admin1 logged in" / "admin1 logged out"           |

All of the above contain `# (SYD) ADDED ADMIN LOG` comments in the codebase.

---

### üóÖÔ∏è Admin Logs Web Interface

#### üìÑ `admin_logs.html`

* Added a new HTML template: `templates/admin/admin_logs.html`
* Table format showing:

  * Timestamp
  * Admin username
  * Action name
  * Details

#### üîó Route Added: `/admin/logs`

* Accessible only to users with `is_admin` or `is_manager`
* Allows admins to monitor recent privileged actions

---

### üí† Database Integration

* Table auto-created via `db.create_all()` or Flask-Migrate
* Logs stored in the `admin_action_log` table
* Query example:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM admin_action_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
  ```

---

### üìå Note for Reviewers/Developers

* Every new log entry is handled server-side via Python.
* Print statements like `[DEBUG] Logging admin action: XYZ` help trace execution in the terminal.
* All related code is clearly marked with:

  ```python
  # (SYD) ADDED ADMIN LOG
  ```
